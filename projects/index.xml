      <description>Original work by Rhizomatiks and Ryuichi Sakamoto, I was asked to partake in the update and installation of Sensing Streams for ACT Festival Korea 2018 held in Gwanju, South Korea.
With the theme of this year&amp;rsquo;s festival being, Otherly Space Knowledge , Rhizomatiks was asked to exhibit Sensing Streams for its outlook on radio waves around us that we cannot see, but use everyday.
The installation is reactive to the radio frequencies that are sensed realtime throughout the room , creating a realization of the waves around us.</description>

      <description>As part of the YUIMA NAKAZATO Paris Couture 18SS, technical research was displayed during the show to display the process of the design and the concept behind the show pieces.
&amp;ldquo;Mobile Factory&amp;rdquo; is a key concept behind the show pieces, speculating on the future of fashion where fashion itself is not limited to the studio of the fashion designer or the factory.

      <description>Being invited by Daijiro Mizuno Lab, I explored the technical possibilities and researched for initial prototypes and creation for the Yuima Nakazato 2018 Spring Summer Paris Couture Fashion Week.
Inital concepts about the collection were traded among our team and the fashion label, creating initial sketches and prototypes that would give some vision on what kind of structure and detail could be made.
Inspirations came from attractors and gravity fields, which held beauty in being simple mathmatical equations that harvested detailed graphical outputs</description>

      <description>Junction Asia was created in a joint program with the Junction in Helsinki, that would partake a week before Slush happened.
 Junction Asia was created with the international audience as well as designers in mind, who would be hesitant to join other hackathons that heavily focused on the use of APIs.
 Through the production of the event, I participated in collaborating with companies through sponsorships, and the production of the venue.</description>
