      <description>Original work by Rhizomatiks and Ryuichi Sakamoto, I was asked to partake in the update and installation of Sensing Streams for ACT Festival Korea 2018 held in Gwanju, South Korea.
With the theme of this year&amp;rsquo;s festival being, Otherly Space Knowledge , Rhizomatiks was asked to exhibit Sensing Streams for its outlook on radio waves around us that we cannot see, but use everyday.
The installation is reactive to the radio frequencies that are sensed realtime throughout the room , creating a realization of the waves around us.</description>

      <description>As part of the YUIMA NAKAZATO Paris Couture 18SS, technical research was displayed during the show to display the process of the design and the concept behind the show pieces.
&amp;ldquo;Mobile Factory&amp;rdquo; is a key concept behind the show pieces, speculating on the future of fashion where fashion itself is not limited to the studio of the fashion designer or the factory.

      <description>Along with the YUIMA NAKAZATO Paris Couture 18SS Fashion show that was exhibited in Paris, I was asked to participate along with members of the Daijiro Mizuno Lab to help exhibit the show pieces at the 2121 Design Sight located in Roppongi, Tokyo.
Not only other fashion designers, but also artists, engineers, and other creators from different backgrounds were invited to help share the vision that the company had, and also to speculate about the future of the fashion industry.</description>

      <description>Being invited by Daijiro Mizuno Lab, I explored the technical possibilities and researched for initial prototypes and creation for the Yuima Nakazato 2018 Spring Summer Paris Couture Fashion Week.
Inital concepts about the collection were traded among our team and the fashion label, creating initial sketches and prototypes that would give some vision on what kind of structure and detail could be made.
Inspirations came from attractors and gravity fields, which held beauty in being simple mathmatical equations that harvested detailed graphical outputs</description>

      <description>This project was for a Digital Fabrication Class held in the summer of 2017, to fabricate a product that would help people be able to participate in urban tacticalism in Yokohama. We designed a bench and table system using CNC and CAD software that would allow people to create benches and tables from already avaliable structure in Yokohama.

Created the Xperia XZ camera booth for IFA 2016 as part of Abacus Inc, a digital conglomerate headed by Saito Tatsuya. The interactive booth showcased some of the possibilities of the new flagship from Sony.
 3 booths were setup to showcase the features of the camera that came with the flagship smartphone.
The first is the shutter speed of the smartphone, which was displayed by the use of a toy train running along a track.</description>

      <description>Junction Asia was created in a joint program with the Junction in Helsinki, that would partake a week before Slush happened.
 Junction Asia was created with the international audience as well as designers in mind, who would be hesitant to join other hackathons that heavily focused on the use of APIs.
 Through the production of the event, I participated in collaborating with companies through sponsorships, and the production of the venue.</description>

      <description>Slush Asia is a project that was started in 2015 with the help of Taizo Son and members of Mistletoe, being the first international Slush that was held outside of Finland. Slush is originally an event that brings together entrepreneurs, investors, startups and students together to discuss and collaborate on working towards the future. \\
Slush Asia 2016 was the first event that respected the ways in which Slush in Finland was organized and run by wholly by approximately 2000 students in Finland.</description>
